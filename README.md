Moji is a fully functional interpreter for a programming language that uses emojis as its core syntax. Instead of `if`, `while`, or `print`, Moji uses `🤔`, `🔁`, and `🖨️`. 

This project was created as the final assignment for the Compiler course at Unisagrado.

## ✨ Features 

* **Expressive Syntax:** Write code using intuitive emojis. 
* **Core Logic:** Full support for variables, conditional logic (`if/else`), and loops (`while`). 
* **Data Types:** Handles numbers (`🔢`), strings (`🔡`), and booleans (`👍`/`👎`). 
* **I/O:** Print to the console (`🗣️`) and read user input (`⌨️`). 
* **Math Operations:** Standard arithmetic (`➕`, `➖`, `✖️`, `➗`). 
* **Built in Python:** Uses the powerful _TBD_ library for parsing.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run Moji

We offer two easy ways to run your Moji code.

### ⭐️ Method 1: Run in your Browser (Google Colab)

No installation required! We have prepared a Google Colab notebook that lets you write and run Moji code directly in your browser. This is the fastest and easiest way to try Moji.

### 💻 Method 2: Run Locally (CLI)

You can run Moji on your local machine by following these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone TBD
cd TBD
```

**Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install dependencies:** All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run a Moji file:** To run a Moji program (we use the `.moji` file extension), pass the file path to our main interpreter script:

```
python main.py examples/hello.moji
```

Check the `/examples` folder for more sample code!
